# Self Made Tennis Ball Machine

## Description 
  This repository contains the code, general manufacturing steps, and basic overview of the main electronic components used in creating my own tennis ball feeding machine. The code for this project originally started in Arduino IDE and is in the process of migrating to platformIO. The project is not fully complete and still has around 25% left in order to meet the original requirements and be fully automated. While this readme will not be a step by step guide on how to build a tennis ball machine from scratch, I will do my best to list key details, materials, and obstacles I faced as I continue to document my journey with this project. 

  If you happen to decide to take on the task of making your own tennis ball machine, please understand this project is not for the faint of heart. It will require technical, mechanical, and electrical knowledge as well as a  variety of power tools in order to create a functional machine. If you're still set on making your very own tennis ball machine, I strongly suggest to use this readme and my experience as a guide and reference and not a step by step tutorial. There is more than one way to make a ball machine and the specific capabilities desired differ from person to person. 
  
  I suggest looking at other machines people have made across the internet and use this guide, as well as others, to formulate your own plan and process on how you want your tennis ball machine to function and the "must have" functions that will best advance your game on the court!
