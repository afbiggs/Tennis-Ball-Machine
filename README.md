# 🎾 DIY Self-Made Tennis Ball Machine

![Tennis Ball Machine](images/tennis-ball-machine.gif)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the code, general manufacturing steps, and an in-depth overview of the main electronic and mechanical components used in creating my own **DIY tennis ball feeding machine**. This README is not complete but is currently being worked on in oder to include all major components used and a general build guide of the project.  

> **Status:** ⏳ *Project is 75% complete* — still working on full automation of the feeding mechanism. **PICTURES AND VIDEOS OF THE MACHINE FUNCTIONING IN ITS CURRENT STATE WILL BE COMING SOON!**

⚠️ *This is not a step-by-step tutorial but rather a detailed reference guide for those looking to build their own machine!*

## 🎯 Why Did I Make This?

As an avid tennis player, I am always looking for hitting partners and new ways to advance my abilities on the court. Ball machines are a great tool, as they allow you to recreate just about any shot and practice it over and over again. This was my primary motivation for building my own.

### So why not just buy one?

Sure, purchasing a professionally built, high-quality machine is the simplest solution—until you see the **$1,200+** price tag! Plus, buying a machine and calling it quits does little to fullfil my consistent, unexplainable, and rather enigmatic desire to take on extensive projects I have little to absolutely no experience with. This challenge felt like the perfect opportunity to merge my love for **software & microcontroller development, engineering, and tennis**.

💡 If you're considering making your own machine, be aware that this project requires **mechanical, fabrication, electrical, and programming knowledge**, along with a variety of power tools. It is not for the faint of heart. However, if you're up for the challenge, I hope this README serves as a valuable reference but it will not be a step by step build guide. A more in-depth video showing and explaining the build will be coming soon and I am more than happy to answer any question and help how I can if you do decide to build your own ball machine.

## 🔧 Requirements

To ensure this project is worth the effort, my DIY ball machine needed to meet the following requirements:

✅ **Ball Spin Control** — Ability to apply **topspin or backspin** via two independently controlled throwing wheels.  
✅ **Throwing Speed** — Must be capable of launching balls at **60+ mph**.  
✅ **Adjustable Throwing Angle** — Flexibility to modify shot trajectory.  
✅ **Portability** — Compact and lightweight enough for easy transport.  
✅ **Battery Powered** — With optional AC power support.  
✅ **Auto Feeding** — Large holding capacity with an **adjustable BPM (Balls Per Minute)** setting.

## 🛠️ List of Main Materials

### 🔌 Electronics

| Component | Image | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Arduino Mega R3 2560** | ![Arduino Mega](images/arduino-mega-r3.jpg) | - Chosen for its numerous **I/O ports**, essential for motor and sensor control. <br><br> - Supports **PWM signals**, crucial for motor speed adjustments. <br><br> - Compatible with various expansion modules for future upgrades. |
| **(2) 150W 24V, 5500RPM PMDC Motors** | ![Motors](images/ball-machine-motors.png) | - High **RPM** ensures the machine can launch balls at **60+ mph**. <br><br> - **Permanent magnet design** provides consistent performance. <br><br> - Selected for optimal balance between power and energy efficiency. <br><br> - ⚠️ *Note: Beyond the motor's total power capabilities and RPMs, the rated **Stall Current** of the motors need to be considered!* |
| **MDD10A Cytron Dual-Channel Motor Driver** | ![Motor Driver](images/mdd10a-motor-driver.png) | - Controls both throwing motors independently. <br><br> - Supplies up to **10 Amps at 30 Volts per channel.** <br><br>- Supports **bidirectional control**, allowing for spin variations. <br><br> - Uses **PWM signals** to regulate motor speed efficiently. |
| **24VDC Worm Gear Motor** | ![Ball Hopper Motor](images/24VDC-worm-gear-motor.png) | - This motor is used for spinning the ball hopper for the **Auto Feeding** mechanism. <br><br> - Gearbox reduces speed to roughly **7-12 RPMs** and the balls per minute rate will be controlled by user. <br><br> - While the gearbox reduces the motors RPMs, it retains a **High Torque** rating. |
| **Nema 17 Stepper Motor** | ![Nema 17 Stepper](images/nema17-stepper.png) | - Stepper motor used for adjusting ball throwing angle. <br><br> - Chosen for its **Accuracy, Low power, Smooth Speed, Stable Performance.** <br><br> - Motor was repurposed from a non-functioning 3D printer. | 
| **B10K Potentiometers 10K ohm** | ![B10K Pot](images/b10k-potentiometerr-10k-ohm.webp) | - Used for **Controlling Speed** of each throwing wheel. <br><br> - In the machines current form, these also **Control Ball Spin** by simply speeding up/slowing down 1 wheel. |
| **24VDC 400W Power Supply** | ![24VDC Power Supply](images/24VDC-power-supply.jpg) | - Currently for ease and testing purposes the ball machine is being powered by a 400 watt AC to DC 24V power Supply. <br><br> - Power supply repurposed from non-functioning 3D printer. <br><br> - **Will be replaced with a DC battery** in order to meet project requirements. |
| **24V 20Ah Battery Lithium Battery** | ![24V Lithium Battery](images/24v-lithium-battery.png) | - Example of battery that will be used and replace the ACt to DC power supply. <br><br> - Battery is capable of providing **Over 400 watts** which is needed to smoothly power the large throwing wheel motors. <br><br> - Lithium battery is much **Lighter and More Compact** than lead-acid battery. |
