# Self Made Tennis Ball Machine

## Description 
  This repository contains the code, general manufacturing steps, and basic overview of the main electronic components used in creating my own tennis ball feeding machine. The code for this project originally started in Arduino IDE and is in the process of migrating to platformIO. The project is not fully complete and still has around 25% left in order to meet the original requirements and be fully automated. While this readme will not be a step by step guide on how to build a tennis ball machine from scratch, I will do my best to list key details, materials, and obstacles I faced as I continue to document my journey with this project. 

  If you happen to decide to take on the task of making your own tennis ball machine, please understand this project is not for the faint of heart. It will require technical, mechanical, and electrical knowledge as well as a  variety of power tools in order to create a functional machine. If you're still set on making your very own tennis ball machine, I strongly suggest to use this readme and my experience as a guide and reference and not a step by step tutorial. There is more than one way to make a ball machine and the specific capabilities desired differ from person to person. 
  
  I suggest looking at other machines people have made across the internet and use this guide, as well as others, to formulate your own plan and process on how you want your tennis ball machine to function and the "must have" functions that will best advance your game on the court!

## Why Did I Make This?
As an avid tennis player I am always looking for hitting partners and new ways to advance my abilities on the court. Ball machines are a great tool as they can allow you to recreate just about any shot and practice it over and over again, which was ultimately my main reason for wanting one. 

So why don't I just go and buy one?

Sure, buying an already made, modern, highly engineered, fully functioning out of the box ball machine is the most logical solution here right? Thats until I realized the price for one with at least all the requirements listed below starts at $1,200 minimum. Plus, buying a machine and calling it quits does little to fullfil my consistent, unexplainable, and rather enigmatic desire to take on extensive projects I have little to absolutely no experience with. 

With that said, the only viable and clear solution here was to hurl myself into a world unbeknown to me called Mechanical Engineering.

## Requirements
There are many features across the range of ball machines currently on the market. The features that I value the most and deemed as requirements to incorporate into my build include:
* Ball Spin Control (applying topspin or backspin to the ball) with 2 separately driven throwing wheels.
* Throwing speed of at least 60mph+.
* Throwing angle adjustment.
* Portable enough to "easily" transport.
* Battery powered and maybe the option to run it off AC power.
* Auto feeding with a large holding capacity and adjustable rate for BPM (Balls Per Minute)

There are other small features here and there I have added and will continue to add, but the list above are the main requirements I defined at the start of this journey in order for my DIY ball machine to be worth it. 

## List of Main Materials (please read below) 
Now when it comes to the materials list, its hard for me to make an all inclusive list down to each bolt and screw. This is largely due to the culmination of "lets see if this will work" parts, which has slowly but surely turned into a large box of indiscriminate bolts, screws,etc. In all seriousness I should have foreseen that happening and done a better job at documenting each piece of hardware I ended up using. 

As I get closer to the end I will update this list and aim to have a more detailed guide for each part used in the different components. For now I'll list and provide links for the electronic components and the must have hardware pieces.
